simple steganography
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cherdt/simple-steganography.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cherdt/simple-steganography)

A small web application that allows users to create
and decode steganographic images. It can be found at:
(http://osric.com/chris/steganography/)

*def. steganography:*
the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or 
file within another message, image, or file
(https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steganography)

This project is just-for-fun, mostly to look deeper
into image manipulation using Javascript and the HTML5 
canvas element, as well as drop-and-drag funtionality.

If you actually want to send someone a secret message,
do not use this web application. In the words of 
Benjamin Franklin, "Three may keep a secret if two of 
them are dead."
